---

### **Step 2: Customize Your Settings**

#### **📚 Spaced Repetition Parameters**

Navigate to **Settings** to configure:

1. **Growth Factor** (how quickly intervals increase)
    - **Conservative (1.5x)**: Review more frequently — better retention
    - **Balanced (1.7x)**: Middle ground
    - **Aggressive (2.0x)**: Review less often — cover more problems faster

   *Example*: Problem intervals with 2.0x growth: 1 day → 2 days → 4 days → 8 days → 16 days

2. **Maximum Review Interval**
    - Longest time between reviews (default: 40 days)
    - Even mastered problems will be reviewed at least once every X days
    - *Recommended: 30-40 days*

3. **Starting Interval**
    - How soon you review after first solving (default: 1 day)
    - *1 day = review tomorrow (best for retention)*
    - *3 days = if you're very confident*

4. **Leech Threshold**
    - Number of "Low" confidence failures before marking as 🩸 Leech
    - *Recommended: 3-5 failures*

5. **Max Reviews Per Day**
    - Prevents overload by spreading reviews across days
    - *Recommended: 10-20 problems*

#### **⏱️ Time-Based Confidence Suggestions**

Set time thresholds (in minutes) for each difficulty level:

| Difficulty | Mastered | High     | Medium   | Low     |
|------------|----------|----------|----------|---------|
| Easy       | < 5 min  | < 15 min | < 30 min | 30+ min |
| Medium     | < 10 min | < 25 min | < 45 min | 45+ min |
| Hard       | < 20 min | < 40 min | < 60 min | 60+ min |

When you submit a problem, the extension will **auto-suggest** a confidence level based on how long you took!

#### **📅 Study Schedule**

- Check the days you want to study
- Reviews will only be scheduled on selected days
- ⚠️ Must select at least one day

## 🔄 Spaced Repetition Logic

### **How Confidence Levels Affect Scheduling**

| Confidence   | Effect                       | Next Review              |
|--------------|------------------------------|--------------------------|
| **Mastered** | ✅ Advance 1 stage            | Longer interval          |
| **High**     | ✅ Advance 1 stage            | Longer interval          |
| **Medium**   | ⏸️ Stay same or drop 1 stage | Similar/shorter interval |
| **Low**      | ⬇️ Reset to stage 1          | Review sooner (1 day)    |

### **Stage Progression Example**

Assuming **2.0x growth factor** and **1 day starting interval**:

| Stage | Interval         | Total Days Since Start |
|-------|------------------|------------------------|
| 0     | New problem      | 0                      |
| 1     | 1 day            | 1                      |
| 2     | 2 days           | 3                      |
| 3     | 4 days           | 7                      |
| 4     | 8 days           | 15                     |
| 5     | 16 days          | 31                     |
| 6     | 32 days          | 63                     |
| 7     | 40 days (capped) | 103                    |
| 8     | 40 days (capped) | 143                    |

### **Leech System**

A problem becomes a **🩸 Leech** when:

- You've submitted "Low" confidence ≥ threshold times (default: 3)
- AND you're still below Stage 3

**Leech forgiveness**: After 3 consecutive "High" or "Mastered" submissions, the leech counter resets!

### **Smart Load Balancing**

When scheduling reviews, the extension:

1. Calculates the ideal review date based on SRS stage
2. Checks if that day already has too many reviews (> max per day)
3. If overloaded, shifts to the next available day
4. Only schedules on your selected study days

This prevents "review avalanches" and keeps your workload manageable!

## 📝 Smart Problem Editor

### **What is it?**

The Smart Problem Editor lets you manually update problem progress when the timer widget fails or you need to fix
mistakes. It's **intelligent** — you only edit what matters (time), and everything else is automatically recalculated
using the same SRS algorithm.

### **How to Access**

- From **⚙️ Settings** → Click **📝 Problem Editor** button (top right)
- From **Extension Popup** → Click **📝 Edit** link (header)

### **What You Can Edit**

1. ✅ **Time** for each attempt (in minutes, clearly labeled)
2. ✅ **Date/timestamp** of each attempt
3. ✅ **Delete** individual attempts
4. ✅ **Add** new attempts manually
5. ✅ **Reset** problem to "Not Started" (deletes all progress)

### **What's Auto-Calculated**

When you click **"Save & Recalculate"**, the editor automatically computes:

- ✅ **Confidence level** (based on time + difficulty + your time thresholds)
- ✅ **SRS Stage** (replays all attempts through SRS algorithm)
- ✅ **Next Review Date** (with load balancing)
- ✅ **Lapses** (number of failures)
- ✅ **Consecutive Successes** (for leech forgiveness)
- ✅ **Leech Status** (🩸 tag)

### **Usage Examples**

#### **Scenario 1: Timer Widget Failed**

You started a problem but the timer didn't work properly:

1. Open the editor and search for the problem
2. Click **"+ Add New Attempt"**
3. Enter the time you actually spent (e.g., "25" minutes)
4. Watch the confidence automatically update (e.g., "MEDIUM")
5. Click **"Save & Recalculate"**
6. ✅ Everything recalculated correctly!

#### **Scenario 2: Logged Wrong Time**

You accidentally submitted with the wrong time:

1. Search for the problem
2. Find the attempt with the incorrect time
3. Change "5" to "45" minutes
4. Watch confidence change from "MASTERED" to "LOW" (live preview!)
5. Click **"Save & Recalculate"**
6. ✅ SRS stage, lapses, review date all updated automatically

#### **Scenario 3: Accidental Submission**

You submitted by mistake or want to remove an attempt:

1. Find the problem
2. Click the **✕** button on the wrong attempt
3. Click **"Save & Recalculate"**
4. ✅ Problem recalculated as if that attempt never happened

### **How It Works**

The editor uses **event sourcing** — it treats your attempts as a sequence of events:

1. Takes all your attempts with their times
2. Auto-calculates confidence for each based on time thresholds
3. Replays them **in order** through the SRS algorithm
4. Arrives at the correct final state

This guarantees **100% consistency** between the editor and the timer widget — they use the exact same code!

### **Live Preview**

As you type a time value, the confidence level updates **instantly** so you can see what will happen before you save:

- Type "10" min on an Easy problem → Shows "MASTERED"
- Type "35" min on an Easy problem → Shows "LOW"

No guessing needed!

2. Make sure you published the sheet as CSV (not HTML)
3. Click **🔄 Refresh List** in the popup
4. Check browser console for errors (`F12` → Console tab)

### **"Failed to fetch from Google Sheet" error**

**Causes**:

- Sheet URL is incorrect
- Sheet is not published to web
- Sheet columns are missing or misspelled
- Network connection issue

**Solution**:

1. Re-publish your Google Sheet to web as CSV
2. Copy the new URL
3. Update in Settings
4. Click Refresh List

### **Widget not showing on LeetCode**

**Solution**:

1. Make sure you're on a problem page (`leetcode.com/problems/...`)
2. Refresh the LeetCode page
3. Check if the extension is enabled in `chrome://extensions/`
4. Reload the extension

### **Emojis showing as boxes or question marks**

**Solution**:

3. Clear browser cache and reload extension

### **Timer keeps resetting**

This happens when navigating between tabs on the same problem (e.g., Description → Solutions). This is intentional to
prevent confusion.

**Workaround**: Stay on one tab while solving.

### **Reviews not scheduling on my study days**

**Check**:

1. Go to Settings → Study Schedule
2. Make sure at least one day is checked
3. If all days are unchecked, the extension defaults to all days
